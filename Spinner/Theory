A Spinner in Android is a UI widget that allows the user to select an item from a dropdown list.

AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener is an interface in Android that provides callback methods to
handle item selection events in AdapterView-based UI components, such as Spinner, ListView, and GridView.
When a user selects an item from the view, this listener notifies your application so that you can perform 
actions based on that selection.

The OnItemSelectedListener interface has two primary methods:

onItemSelected(AdapterView<?> parent, View view, int position, long id):
onNothingSelected(AdapterView<?> parent)
